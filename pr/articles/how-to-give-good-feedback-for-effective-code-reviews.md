## Feedback Technique 1: The “Show and Tell” Review

You provide screenshots or links to other sources that help explain the benefit of the new approach that you’re suggesting to your fellow contributor.

## Feedback Technique 2: The “Chameleon” Review

I highly recommend giving feedback via dialogic questions

## Feedback Technique 3: Two Peas in a Pod

The “Two Peas in a pod” is a PR review technique where you comment on one line of code in the conversation while another contributor gives feedback on another line code in the same pull request

## Feedback Technique 4: Teach’em Review

This “Teach’em” review is a PR review technique where you pretty much instruct your peer on how to improve their PR instead of just pointing out the issues in the PR.

## Feedback Technique 5: The “Suggestion” Review

If you're focusing on other open source projects, have a deadline for an assignment, or you're just tired from a long day at work but want to review pull requests, this feedback giving technique will be the ultimate tool in your open sourcer kit. It focuses on giving constructive feedback through your review.
